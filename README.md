EDA project. Cleaning and analyzing data on VNL 2023.

## Steps to EDA:

### 1 - Data Understanding
Import the dataset and get a feel for it. In other words, view the columns, general statistics, data types of the values.

### 2 - Data Preparation
After getting a fair understanding of the dataset, prepare the dataset for analysis. This means, remove an duplicates, null values, unused observations, etc.

### 3 - Feature Understanding
Look at each feature themselves to understand distribution and potential outliers. Univariate analysis with boxplots, histograms, bar graphs.

### 4 - Feature Relationships
Look at features together to understand relationships between them. Multivariate analysis with scatterplots, heatmaps, pairplots.
